# shipirate

Shipirate is a personal project.
It represents an imaginary VPN service which was built for fun with the intention of exercising my programming skills and does not provide any real services.

The website is divided in 5 sections:

- Banner
- Features
- Subscription plans
- Testimonials
- Footer

Website features:

- Dark mode
- Authentication
- User profile with options such as changing the user's email
- Payment form (by this time without validation since it doesn't actually execute any purchases)
- Admin-only routes for modifying the page content such as adding a new subscription plan

Technologies used:

- HTML, CSS, Tailwindcss, Javascript, React.js, Node.js, Vite (planning to also use Docker in the future).
