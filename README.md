# shipirate
This is my first major personal project.
Shipirate is a website that serves for an imaginary VPN service with a pirate theme.
The website is divided in 5 sections:
- Banner / Hero
- Features
- Subscription plans
- Testimonials
- Footer
Login, Signup, Payment form and 404 are also present (on the front end).

Major functionality that I currently work on: API (using node.js, followed by Docker in the future)
