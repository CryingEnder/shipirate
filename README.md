# shipirate
This is my first major personal project.
Shipirate is a website that serves for an imaginary VPN service with a pirate theme.
The website is divided in 5 sections:
- Banner / Hero
- Features
- Subscription plans
- Testimonials
- Footer
Login, Signup, Payment form and 404 are also present (on the front end).

A mention about the commits history:  The initial commit already had code written in it, that's because when I started the project i didn't know how to use git, but later on in the development i learned how to use it. 

The technologies I use are: HTML, CSS, JS, React.js, Tailwindcss, node.js, Vite and (soon) Docker.
Major functionality that I currently work on: API (using node.js, followed by Docker in the future)
